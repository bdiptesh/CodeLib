## Introduction

#### Objective

The objective of this repository is to:

1. Create a code library/toolkit to automate commonly used machine learning techniques/approaches in a modular environment.
1. Provide best in class approaches developed over a period of time.
1. Reduce development time for machine learning projects.
1. Provide a scalable solution for all machine learning projects.

#### Project structure

This repository provides a sample structure of a project. Since we would like to have a common structure for all our projects, the structure should be able to scale with large of applications with internal packages.

In larger applications, we may have one or more internal packages that are either tied together with a wrapper shell script or that provide specific functionality to a larger library we are packaging. We will lay out the conventions to accommodate for this:

```

#### Programming style

It's good practice to follow accepted standards while coding in python:
1. [PEP 8 standards](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/): For code styles.
1. [PEP 257 standards](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/): For docstrings standards.

However, it's a good idea to rate all our python scripts with pylint. If we score anything less than 8/10, we should consider redesigning the code architecture.

A composite pylint ratings for all the codes are automatically computed when we [run the tests](./bin/runTests.sh) and prepended on top of this file.

#### Version control

We use semantic versionning ([SemVer](https://semver.org/)) for version control. You can read about semantic versioning [here](https://semver.org/).

## Initial setup

#### Installation

Extract the project in a local directory. Example:

```console
/home/user/project/CodeLib/
```

Run the following in project directory:

```console
chmod +x install.sh
./install.sh
```

Anaconda python 3.7.3 was used for development of this module.

The code was tested in the following environments.
1. [Anaconda python 3.7.3 64-Bit](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/)

The python requirements can be found at
1. [Linux 64-Bit](./requirements.txt)
***

## Execution

Run the following in project directory:

```console
python main_module
```

***
## Run unit tests and pylint ratings

To run all unit tests and rate all python scripts, run the following in
project directory:

```console
./bin/runTests.sh
```

Available options:

```console
-a default, runs both code rating and unit tests.
-u unit tests.
-r code rating.
```
The pylint ratings for each python script can be found at
[log/pylint/](./log/pylint/)
